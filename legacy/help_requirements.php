print"<td class='help-text'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RTH is designed to help manage requirements in several ways.  First, any requirement uploaded into RTH is stored under version control and the the system records the date, time, and person who uploaded the requirement.  Version control is crucial to managing files effectively.  Second, you can create assignments for each requirement version.  You can assign each version to a release or to an individual.   You can quickly find all requirements assigned to a particular release or person by using the filter funcionality on the main requirements page.  Simply filter for a release and all requirements assigned to the release appear.</td>". NEWLINE;
print"</tr>". NEWLINE;
print"<tr>". NEWLINE;
print"<td class='help-text'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can also associate certain meta-data to a requirement version.  Meta data is simply data that describes data.  There are several such fields related to requirements.  RTH allows users to associate the Document Type, Functionality, Area Covered, Priority to each requirement version.  These four fields are all meta-data which any RTH manager or administrator can control.  By clicking on the Manage hyperlink on the main menu, and selecting the appropriate Project, users can add values that are meaningful to their particular project in the fields described above.  The Release field is similar as the field is also populated with any release names added by clicking on the 'Release' hyperlink.</td>". NEWLINE;
print"</tr>". NEWLINE;
print"<tr>". NEWLINE;
print"<td class='help-text'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another advantage of storing requirements in RTH is that you can relate requirements to other requirements or relate requirements to tests.  This is useful if you want to run tests and see exactly which requirements you've tested and the percetage of the requirements covered.  Even if you store your requirements in another system, you can still take advantage of this reporting capability by simply storing a reference to a requirement within RTH.  For instance, you may store your requirements in a web based version control system or on a file server.  Simply, cut and paste the url or path to the requirement, link your tests, and you can run a series of tests and produce a real-time requirement coverage report.</td>". NEWLINE;

In many companies, requests from customers are logged and a ticketing system (change control tool, bug tracker, help desk ticketing system, or combination of the three) becomes the system of record.  The ticketing system may contain everything a developer needs to enhance the product. RTH contains a defect tracking system but can also link quite easily into any web based ticketing system.

print"<td class='help-text'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RTH can store requirements in two different ways.  Click on the Requirements link on the main menu, and you'll notice two options for adding requirements on the sub-menu.  You can add a 'Requirement Record' or add a 'Requirement File'.  Deciding how to store requirements depends on the level of traceability your project requires and the types of requirements you're using.  If you need detailed test coverage reports, you may want to add record based requirements.  While record-based requirements offer greater traceability, they are more work to maintain.  Generally, the extra work isn't worth the effort unless you're developing something that would cause great harm if it failed.  NASA and the NYSE, for instance, might document each requirement as a record so that they can ensure that every requirement is adequately tested.  If your company is already using documents for their requirements and they don't require detailed traceability between test results and requirements, document based requirements may suffice.  Many companies have success using a combination of the two.  Using file based requirement to upload nuclear documents such as use cases or gui specifications, and using record based requirements for functional requirements.</td>". NEWLINE;
