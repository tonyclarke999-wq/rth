Requirements and Defects can be assigned to any Release added to a project.  This feature is designed to help with Scope/Release management.  By assigning Requirements or Defects to a release, it is easy to view the workload for a given release.  The results of all test execution within RTH are related back to a release, build, and test set.  Without adding a release and build to RTH, you cannot run any tests.  If you're using Ant or some other means of automating a build, tying the build process into RTH should not be much trouble.  Simply write a record to the Release and Build tables in RTH with each build.</td>". NEWLINE;

print"<td class='help-text'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before explaining how to add or edit a Test Set, you may be hoping that we'll explain its meaning. A Test Set is a group of tests planned to run against a specific build and release.  If there is a build that only effects a specific module of your application, you may want to run only your tests that cover this area of the application. Hence, the test set is born.  As mentioned above, a test set must be associated with a release and build, therefore, a description of how to add a release and build will follow.  Any user can add a release, build, or test set but only those with Manager rights or who have Delete rights can delete them.</td>". NEWLINE;
