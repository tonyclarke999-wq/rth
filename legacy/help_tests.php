print"<td class='help-text'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The test module within RTH is the heart of the system and relates in some way to every other module in the system (requirements, releases, test execution, and defects).  A thorough understanding of the test module is important to a successful implementation of RTH, although the modules within RTH can be used independently.  You can, for instance, use only the defect tracking module without using the functionality within the test module.  The level of integration is up to you, but it's best if you have a thorough understanding of both the Test and Test Results module if you want to use RTH to monitor and report on testing.  There is a seperate help section on Test Results but the lines between Test and Test Results may blur at times so we strongly recommend that you read both sections.</td>". NEWLINE;

The 'BA Owner' and 'QA Owner' fields, for instance, assume that there is a division of labor between the Business Analyst that's writing a requirement or test and the QA engineer who is automating or executing the test.  Our assumption is that the person writing the test case and ther person automating a test could be in different departments, offices, or on a different continent altogether and we wanted the design to support this type of organizational structure.</td>".

RTH allows users to define a Test Status, Test Area, Test Type, BA Owner, QA Owner, Tester etc. for each test.  All the data related to tests is discussed in detail below.

There is some workflow built into RTH that will automatically update the test status.  If a test is related to a requirement and the requirement changes in any way, the system will automatically update the test status to 'Review Requirement'.  This is intended to help a tester to understand what tests need to be reviewed with changes to the requirements.  If the test changes in any way (a test step is added or modified, a new file is uploaded, etc.) the system will change the status to 'Review Test Case'.  This is intended to help when there is a distibuted test team where one person is writing a test while another is automating the test.  We want to make sure an automation engineer knows when a test case is updated so that they can update their automation.  The other statuses are intended to help understand the phase of development of the test.  Is the test currently being developed (WIP), ready for peer review (Ready for Review), ready for execution (Completed), etc.  The test status also appears on the 'Create Test Set' page and can help to define what tests should be included in a test set.
